## MakeSpace Coding Challenge

### The Goal
Create a simple client-side To Do list app. The attached image is a guideline, don't worry about using the exact same colors and build on it as necessary. Demonstrate your HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge and understanding of UI/UX concerns.

We'd love to see you use [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) for your front-end MVC. You shouldn't need any other libraries (Backbone's dependencies aside) but feel free to include any library you'd like.

Please organize and document your code as if it were going into production and include a short `README`. When you're done, send us a link to the repository on github.
